Finished a draft of this query.

There are currently no test record marked with 'Claimed returned'. We'll need data for final testing. For now I left that item status filter empty.

---

The prototype example results show a "loan count" field. I labeled this "loan count historical" because it shows the total number of loans all-time for this item, no date filters. I can instead filter this count by the parameter date range if preferred.

---

I'm pulling user first/middle/last name and email. The sample data shows empty fields. Is this data being scrubbed for privacy purposes before moved to LDP?

---

These fields were requested in the prototype but I'm not finding them in LDP tables:

inventory_items.itemVolumeNumber?
(I don't see this value in inventory items, holdings, instances)

inventory_items.notes: description
  inventory_items.data has a notes array
  inventory_holdings.data has a notes array

inventory_holdings.temporaryLocationID
(inventory_holdings only lists a permanent location ID)

circulation_loans.itemEffectiveLocationAtCheckOut
(this field no longer exists; closest is checkout_service_point_id)

circulation_loans.claimedReturnedDate
(there is a return_date, not a claimedReturnedDate)

inventory_instances.dateOfPublication
(I don't see this value in items, holdings, instances)

inventory_instances.cataloguedDate
(I don't see this value in items, holdings, instances)
